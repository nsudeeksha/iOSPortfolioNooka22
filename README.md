# iOS Portfolio
Hello, I am Sudeeksha Nooka. I am currently a senior at Eden Prairie High School. I have taken Cybersecurity and iOS App Development. I am currently taking AP Computer Science A and Advanced iOS App Development. Below are some of the projects I have helped to create. 

## 2021

[TODO](https://github.com/nsudeeksha/TODO) 
This was the first app I worked on in iOS. It allows you to create a list of items. The items are able to be added, deleted, and moved around. TODO let me become more familiar with swift and helped me in future projects. 

[Pocket Pantry](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/GroceryTest)
I spent most of my time in regular iOS App Development working on this project with a classmate. This app allows the user to be able to keep inventory of their pantry, store recipes, create grocery lists, and set a meal planning calendar. This class was online at the time due to covid-19, so I had to learn how to work online effectively. I learned to use slack and use Github to push and pull code. I also learned how to use Sketch, where I created many different app icons. At the end of the semester, my partner and I had the opportunity to [present](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nVmY10nGP_ObAj1-P91eLsXleMsBEFvc_LefuGG2nTY/edit#slide=id.p) our learning and finished app with the class, as well as share what we would like the change/improve within the app.

## 2022

[EPHS Word Game](https://github.com/90306479/MessagingApp)
For the past couple months, this is an app that I have been working on with a partner. It is an iMessages game that resembles the popular word game "Wordle" but is designed to be played with someone else. This is my first time working on a high-level iMessage app.
